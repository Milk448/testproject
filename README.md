Workshop Booking System - Project Details
Overview
A system to manage workshop bookings where admins create workshops with detailed information and associated time slots, and customers can register, view available workshops, select a specific time slot, and submit a booking. Admins manage bookings and monitor stats via a dashboard. Workshops represent real-life sessions (e.g., "Python 101" or "Yoga Basics") held on specific dates with multiple time options.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
Admin Panel: React with Material-UI (MUI) for the dashboard and components.
Customer Site: React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS for styling.
State Management: Redux Toolkit.
Charts: Recharts for data visualization on the admin dashboard.
Backend:
Runtime/Framework: Node.js with Express.js.
Architecture: Clean Architecture principles should be applied.
Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma for data modeling and queries.
Authentication: JWT for secure login for both customers and admins.
Validation: Zod for form and input validation.
Testing: Jest & Supertest (at least two endpoints must be tested).
Deployment: Containerized with Docker and deployed on a public server (e.g. Vercel).
Admin Panel Pages
Login: Secure login page for admins using JWT authentication.
Dashboard: Displays stats like total bookings, slots filled, and popular workshops (e.g., most booked workshop title), using Recharts for visualizations.
Workshops: Create and manage workshops with fields: title (e.g., "Python 101"), description (e.g., "Learn Python basics"), date (e.g., "2025-07-10"), and max capacity (e.g., 15).
Time Slots: Add and manage time slots for each workshop with start time (e.g., "10:00 AM"), end time (e.g., "12:00 PM"), and available spots (which decrements with bookings).
Bookings: View and update bookings with customer name, email, booked workshop title, time slot, and status (e.g., pending, confirmed, canceled).
Customer Site Pages
Register: Registration page for customers to create an account with name, email, and password.
Workshops: List of available workshops with details and a time slot selection form.
Booking Confirmation: Display booking confirmation with a unique ID after submission.
Endpoints
Customer Site (2)
GET /api/workshops: Retrieve all active workshops with title, description, date, max capacity, and associated time slots (start time, end time, available spots).
POST /api/bookings: Submit a booking with customer name, email, workshop ID, and time slot ID; returns a confirmation ID and updates available spots.
Admin Panel (4)
GET /api/bookings: Fetch all bookings with workshop title, time slot (start/end time), customer name, email, and status.
PUT /api/bookings/:id: Update a bookingâ€™s status (e.g., from pending to confirmed).
POST /api/workshops: Create a workshop with title, description, date, max capacity, and initial time slots.
GET /api/stats: Retrieve stats for the dashboard (e.g., total bookings, slots filled percentage).
Features & Requirements
Authentication: Secure JWT-based login for admins and customer registration.
CRUD Operations: Full CRUD for workshops (including creating them with time slots) and bookings (view, update status).
Soft Deletion: Implement soft deletion for workshops and bookings in the database.
Security:
Rate Limiting: Apply rate limiting to endpoints (e.g., 100 requests/hour per IP).
Input Validation: Use Zod for validating all incoming data (e.g., required fields, correct date/time formats).
Database:
Pagination and Filtering: Implement pagination and filtering on API endpoints that return lists of data (e.g., GET /api/bookings).
Seeding: Create a script to seed the database with initial data for development and testing.
UI/UX:
Customer Site: A clean and responsive interface using Tailwind CSS.
Admin Panel: A functional and data-rich dashboard using MUI.
Documentation: Provide separate READMEs for the admin panel, customer site, and backend, including setup instructions (e.g., Docker commands, environment variables).
Testing: Write a test for at least one endpoint using Jest or Supertest to ensure correct data retrieval.
Extras (Not Mandatory)
RBAC: Role-Based Access Control for different admin roles (e.g., a basic admin vs. a super admin with full control).
CI/CD: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.
